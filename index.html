this will be where i document the odd stuff ive been encountering. Entered old around an farmstead and on the outside i observed an odd mechanical and wire array vaguely similiar to a radar or telecom set up but put on its side, the building had multiple holes in the wall, i observed roughly from the outside altough i did step foot into an opened part of the wall. unlikely to be fully abandoned considering the plot of land it was on but the building was certainly not being furnished and i had not observed anyone actually there at the spot before. As i left at around 7 minutes after chexking out the area i notoces a car above a road on a ridgeline by the explored area with direct line of sight that may have possibly not been moving of me around 100 meters away, as i decended a slope and lost line of sight the car must have started moving across a roadway that led me to encounter it again 4 minutes later as it appeared behind me as i walked in the middle of the road (rarely used by fast cars if ever so the road is generally safe to walk on) and seemed oddly apprehensive when i stood aside to let it through, because of the leading of this road ending with the road being blocked the car had to stop by the coast and two people came out and looked at me as i walked past and even went the same direction until i made a turn heading up to my place inwhich they stopped, this was completely unimportant actually during the day and i genuinely forgot about this encounter within an hour. Later that day at around 23:00 the neighbours dogs started barking and i was able to look outside altough it was very black as its late december bevause ive beeb sleeping on the couch because of visitors, the couch can be viewes by multiple glass doors into the house altough the closest ones are hidden behind eother a thin veil or a view of me would be partially obstructed by the couch which seemed extremely odd since they are often very quiet, infact they never bark at night so it was a first",
Here's some **bold text**.
Here's some *italic text* and [a link to something cool](https://example.com).
Here's them ***together!***
